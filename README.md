arch repo downloader

this program will download ever repo file, and put it in ~/home/$USER/repo_packages

its just the actual packages not the builds.   

this program has to be run with sudo command.   

cd in to the directory, and type sudo ./packagesgrab

but first after you cd into the directory just type: ./setup_lnx.sh

yes its written in qbasic.   easy language to do what we needed it to do.   enjoy!
